SunPhases
============

A simple app to calculate and display sun phases given a date and a location.
Could be useful if you are a photographer (or other uses I don't think of) :)

Things you should be aware of
=============================

This app use the following libs:

* android-support-v4
* google-play-services_lib
* crashlytics (not in production right now due to a strange bug...)
* [SunCalc-Java](https://github.com/florianmski/SunCalc-Java)

***

There is an xml file which is only local (you can see it in the .gitignore) containing the google maps key and the crashlytics key.

If you want to build this app you'll have to add your OWN google maps key in an xml file (see [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start))

This app is available on Google Play for free [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.florianmski.SunPhases)
